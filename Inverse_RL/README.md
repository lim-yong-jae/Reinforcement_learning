# What is inverse RL
 Reinforcement learning uses rewards which are gotten from environment's predefined function. But what if that function is not existed, how we can do reinforcement learning? Many problems from real world, there are not reward functions. So we should devise the method for this situation.   
 Inversere Reinforcement learning can be one of the solution of that situation. It infers reward function from environments by using expert trajectories data. So it does not need reward functions, because it infers it. In this repository i summarize papers which are related with Inverse Reinforcement Learning(IRL), and add proofs, explanation, my insights.
